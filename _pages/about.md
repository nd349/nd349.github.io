I am Nikhil Dadheech, a PhD student at the University of Washington. I work with Dr. Alex Turner on developing computationally efficient methods for inferring greenhouse gas fluxes. My research focuses on building physics-guided deep learning model (FootNet) for atmospheric transport to enable scalable flux inversions.

Originally, I am from Chittorgarh city of Rajasthan, India, which is known for its rich history and is home to one of the largest forts in India. Outside of work, you will find me cooking, exploring Washington, and biking around Seattle.
