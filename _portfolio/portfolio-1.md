title: "FootNet: Machine Learning Emulator for Atmospheric Transport"
excerpt: "FootNet model takes meteorology (e.g. winds, PBL height, surface pressure, Gaussian plume etc.) to compute source-receptor relationship (measurement footprint) for an observation. This is an important component of GHG flux inversion.<br/><img src='/images/footnet_unet.png'>"

Full physics atmospheric transport models (e.g. STILT, Flexpart etc.) are computationally expensive as well as storage intensive for high-resolution dense observing systems. Here we developed a machine learning emulator for atmospheric transport (FootNet) which is based on U-Net model architecture. FootNet is trained on measurement footprint outputs from STILT simulations. <br/><img src='/images/footnet_unet.png'>
