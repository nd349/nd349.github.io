title: "FootNet: Deep Learning Emulator for Atmospheric Transport"
excerpt: "FootNet is a physics-guided deep learning model that can emulate atmospheric transport. It is trained on half a million examples generated using a physics-based model (STILT). 
It is 1000x faster than STILT and can compute footprints on-the-fly. <br/><img src='/images/footprint_examples.png'>"

Full physics atmospheric transport models (e.g. STILT, Flexpart etc.) are computationally expensive as well as storage intensive for high-resolution dense observing systems. Here we developed a deep learning emulator for atmospheric transport (FootNet) which is based on U-Net++ architecture. FootNet is trained on half a million footprint outputs from STILT simulations. FootNet computes a footprint 1000x faster than a full physics model and provides a 650x speed up in estimating GHG emission sources using flux inversion. Footprints can be computed on-the-fly with FootNet, which allows for real-time and scalable GHG emission monitoring at high-resolution with dense observing systems.
